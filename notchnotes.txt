Cleanup where sets are set()


#Problem with PlopNotch - are most people pasting news story links, or just entertainment? (Entertainment is news too!)
 
Break up updating into chunks (either with # or with try/except block)

## Process ##

List of usernames. (scrape this from long list, to start with...how would 1000+ be handled?)

At start, save date. 

For each user, try:

get timeline, extract verified links with corresponding story (stories can be added later by checking for null value)
save info at the very end 

except timeout: save this_user to memcache

when there's no more users to update, show it is finished. Then wait a few hours before starting again. (cron will still hit every minute)

if memcache is wiped out, start from beginning. 


## Issues ##

Cluster stories together 

How should alpha status be visualized? (Filling in bell curve? Arrow )

To count clicks, a url shortener would be required (for now)
